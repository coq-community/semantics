synopsis: "A survey of semantics styles, from natural semantics through structural operational, axiomatic, and denotational semantics, to abstract interpretation"
description: """
This is a survey of programming language semantics styles
for a miniature example of a programming language, with their encoding
in Coq, the proofs of equivalence of different styles, and the proof
of soundess of tools obtained from axiomatic semantics or abstract
interpretation.  The tools can be run inside Coq, thus making them
available for proof by reflection, and the code can also be extracted
and connected to a yacc-based parser, thanks to the use of a functor
parameterized by a module type of strings.  A hand-written parser is
also provided in Coq, but there are no proofs associated.
